Elcotel, a telecommunications company, had net income of $ 272, 000, or five cents a share, in its year-earlier second quarter, ended Sept. 30. Revenue totaled $ 5 million. George Pierce, chairman and chief executive officer, said in an interview that earnings in the most recent quarter will be about two cents a share on revenue of just under $ 4 million. [SEP] The lower results, Mr. Pierce said, reflect a 12-month decline in industry sales of privately owned pay telephones, Elcotel's primary business. [SEP] 12-month decline [SEP] Explanation

Felber, who is scheduled to present his report to the 53-nation body Friday, concluded that political condemnation had failed to improve Israeli respect for human rights and there should be a change in methods.
