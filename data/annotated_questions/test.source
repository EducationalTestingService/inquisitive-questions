Hopes for quick enactment of pending deficit-reduction legislation faded as efforts to streamline the House version in advance of a House-Senate conference broke down. House leaders had hoped to follow the Senate's lead by getting an agreement from House committee chairmen under which they would drop items that wouldn't reduce the fiscal 1990 budget deficit from the House-passed bill before the negotiations with the Senate began. But the effort became snagged on the question of what would become of other issues, ranging from cutting the capital-gains tax to child care to repeal of catastrophic-illness insurance. " Many members feel there are important features of the House bill that should be enacted, " Speaker Thomas Foley (D., Wash.) said.

Stories carried Monday by The New York Times, the Guardian, and ProPublica said U. S. and U. K. spies have spent years trawling online games for terrorists or informants. The stories, based on documents leaked by former National Security Agency (NSA) contractor Edward Snowden, offer an unusual take on America's world-spanning surveillance campaign, suggesting that even the fantasy worlds popular with children, teens, and escapists of all ages aren't beyond the attention of the NSA and its British counterpart, GCHQ.

Peering far deeper than ever before into humanity's murky genetic past, scientists sequenced the DNA of an ancient European relative and found a puzzling connection to the Far East. The genetic sample came from a 400, 000-year-old thigh bone pulled from the cold, damp depths of a Spanish cave called Sima de los Huesos, or " Pit of Bones ". Researchers surmised that it belonged to an extinct species of hominin known as Homo heidelbergensis, a direct ancestor of Neanderthals, and they expected it to resemble DNA extracted from of a handful of Neanderthal bones found in Spain, Croatia and other sites in Europe.

A team from New York University has designed a flying jellyfish-like robot that uses four flapping wings to stay aloft.

The rate at which AIDS is spreading in the United States has leveled off and the number of new cases reported every year is falling, health officials said Thursday. The report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention came just three days after the CDC announced that AIDS is now the leading killer of Americans ages 25 to 44. Since the early 1980s, when AIDS cases snowballed by 200 percent a year as it spread through the white homosexual population, the disease is stabilizing at a 3 percent annual increase under an old definition of the disease, according to Dr. John Ward, the CDC's chief of HIV-AIDS surveillance. " It's not growing as rapidly as in earlier years, but the rate is still unacceptably high, " he said. He predicted a similar increase in 1995. [SEP] The AIDS definition was expanded in 1993 to reflect the toll on women, and people with tuberculosis or depressed immune systems. [SEP] expanded [SEP] Explanation
