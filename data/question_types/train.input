" But Mr. Ortega's threat over the weekend to end a 19-month cease-fire with the rebels seeking to topple him, effectively elevated the Contras as a policy priority just as they were slipping from the agendas of their most ardent supporters.

Western doctors have long doubted patients like Alain Franques, who says acupuncture controlled his asthma when drugs failed. Now a critical analysis of meager data concludes there's tantalizing evidence the ancient treatment does help. Using acupuncture as an aid in the treatment of respiratory disease might be safer than prolonged use of drugs alone, Dr. Kim Jobst of Oxford University wrote in Friday's debut issue of the Journal of Alternative and Complementary Medicine. Jobst urged scientists to immediately start rigorous study to prove that, a call that comes as the Food and Drug Administration considers whether to give its stamp of approval to acupuncture.

LOS ANGELES-Adding to the accumulating evidence that Neanderthals were more sophisticated than previously thought, scientists in Europe said that they had unearthed strong evidence that the early hominins-often typecast as brutish, club-lugging ape-men-fashioned their own specialized bone tools. In a report published Monday in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, archaeologists described the discovery of four fragments of bone tools known as lissoirs at two Neanderthal sites in southwest France.

WASHINGTON-When geophysicist H. Jay Melosh attended a meeting of U. S. and ex-Soviet nuclear weapons designers in May 1995, he was surprised by how eager the Cold Warriors were to work together against an unlikely but dangerous extraterrestrial threat : asteroids on a collision course with Earth. After Edward Teller, the father of the hydrogen bomb, urged others meeting at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California to consider building and orbiting huge, new nuclear weapons for planetary protection, some top Russian weapons experts lent their support. " It was a really bizarre thing to see that these weapons designers were willing to work together-to build the biggest bombs ever, " said Melosh, an expert in space impacts who has an asteroid named after him.

Eastern Europeans searching each other's stores for bargains in Soviet caviar, Czech auto parts and Bulgarian sportswear have set off an unprecedented " customs war " in the communist bloc.

LOS ANGELES-Adding to the accumulating evidence that Neanderthals were more sophisticated than previously thought, scientists in Europe said that they had unearthed strong evidence that the early hominins-often typecast as brutish, club-lugging ape-men-fashioned their own specialized bone tools. In a report published Monday in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, archaeologists described the discovery of four fragments of bone tools known as lissoirs at two Neanderthal sites in southwest France. The implements are the oldest specialized bone tools found in Europe, said study lead author Marie Soressi, an archaeologist from Leiden University in the Netherlands.

LOS ANGELES-Adding to the accumulating evidence that Neanderthals were more sophisticated than previously thought, scientists in Europe said that they had unearthed strong evidence that the early hominins-often typecast as brutish, club-lugging ape-men-fashioned their own specialized bone tools. In a report published Monday in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, archaeologists described the discovery of four fragments of bone tools known as lissoirs at two Neanderthal sites in southwest France. The implements are the oldest specialized bone tools found in Europe, said study lead author Marie Soressi, an archaeologist from Leiden University in the Netherlands. Prior to the finds, tools unearthed at Neanderthal sites were almost exclusively made of stone, while bone tools were more common at early modern-human sites-leading many scholars to believe that Neanderthals adopted the technology from their more advanced relatives. [SEP] But the recently unearthed lissoirs, about 41, 000 to 51, 000 years old, could predate the arrival of modern humans in Europe and suggest that Neanderthals might have figured out how to make the tools independently, Soressi and her team wrote.
